=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $p1 = $construction->add_point(position => [100, 150]);

  my $p2 = $construction->add_point('x' => 50, 'y' => 90,
                                    hidden => 1);

  my $p3 = $construction->add_point('x' => 70, 'y' => 130,
                                    style          => {stroke => 'red'},
                                    label          => 'A',
	                            label_offset_x => 5,
	                            label_offset_y => -5);


=head1 DESCRIPTION

An instance of this class represents a user defined free point, as
opposed to a derived point, e.g. an intersection point. An instance
of this class got its position directly from the user. It is created
by using the L<add_point
method|Math::Geometry::Construction/add_point> of
C<Math::Geometry::Construction>.

=head1 INTERFACE

=head2 Public Attributes

=head3 position

Holds a L<Math::Vector::Real|Math::Vector::Real> object with the
position of the point. As initialization argument to the
constructor, you can also give either an array reference or a
C<Math::VectorReal|Math::VectorReal> (C<VectorReal> one word instead
of C<Vector::Real>) object. In the first case, the first two
elements of the array are used to construct the
L<Math::Vector::Real|Math::Vector::Real> object, further elements
are silently ignored. In the second case, the C<x> and C<y>
attributes are used, C<z> is ignored.

As a further option, you can give C<x> and C<y> explicitly.

Examples:

  # Math::Vector::Real object
  $construction->add_point(position => V(1, 4));
  # arrayref
  $construction->add_point(position => [1, 4]);
  # Math::VectorReal object
  $construction->add_point(position => vector(1, 4, 0));
  # x and y
  $construction->add_point('x' => 1, 'y' => 4);

Note that these conversions are only done at construction time (at
least currently). If you want to change the position later you have
to hand a L<Math::Vector::Real|Math::Vector::Real> object to the
mutator method.

Note that you must not alter the elements of the
C<Math::Vector::Real> object directly although the class interface
allows it. This will circumvent the tracking of changes that
C<Math::Geometry::Construction> performs in order to improve
performance.

=head3 size

A point is currently always drawn as a circle. This might become
more flexible in the future. C<size> determines the size of the
point in the output. For a circle it is its diameter. This parameter
is currently C<undef> by default, because the output falls back to
L<radius|/radius> (see below). When C<radius> is removed, C<size>
will default to C<6>.

=head3 radius

Half of L<size|/size>. This attribute is deprecated and might be
removed in a future version. Use L<size|/size> instead.

=head2 General Output Attributes

See
L<Math::Geometry::Construction::Output|Math::Geometry::Construction::Output>.

=head2 Methods

=head3 draw

Called by the C<Construction> object during output generation.
Currently draws a circle of diameter L<size|/size>, but this might
become more flexible in the future.

=head3 id_template

Class method returning C<$ID_TEMPLATE>, which defaults to C<'P%09d'>.
