Revision history for Math-Geometry-Construction

0.010	 Tue Nov  1 21:32:18 NZDT 2011
	 - Fixes two unprotected eval statements, please update.
	 - All constructors that expect a Math::VectorReal object
	   now also accept an ARRAY reference with [x, y] instead.
	 - To construct a circle, you can now give a radius instead
	   of a point on the periphery.
	 - some more tests

0.009	 Mon Oct 31 20:00:38 NZDT 2011
	 - 'radius' attribute of Math::Geometry::Construction::Point
	   is deprecated in favour of 'size'
	 - some convenience changes like default values and the
	   add_derived_point method
	 - expanded docu considerably

0.008	 Sun Oct 23 11:54:49 NZDT 2011
	 - initial support for TikZ output; this is highly
	   experimental and not documented, yet
	 - fixes bug in PointOnLine with quantile

0.007	 Wed Oct 19 20:44:11 NZDT 2011
	 - modified drawing framework in order to prepare it for
	   different output types than SVG; the method as_svg is now
	   only an alias for draw("SVG", ...)
	 - new derivates
	 - fixed "my $_" that had been introduced by find/replace
	   and blew smoke tests on Perl 5.8

0.006	 Sun Oct 16 18:38:08 NZDT 2011
	 - Changed point selection to position selection. This is
	   less future-safe, but more natural and avoids some
	   workarounds. The visible API change is that the point
	   selection methods are renamed to position selection
	   methods. They had not been documented, but showed up in
	   the SYNOPSIS.
	 - The width and height attributes have gone and should be
	   given directly to the output method. Background is now
	   transparent by default, but can be specified via the
	   background attribute.
	 - Lines now accept and expect the support points at
	   construction time.
	 - some more Derivative classes for user convenience

0.005	 Sat Oct 15 19:53:35 NZDT 2011
	 - circles and their intersections with lines and with each
           other
	 - some API simplifications for ease of use
	 - docu fixes and expansion; docu of the main module kind of
           complete

0.004	 Wed Oct 12 19:52:51 NZDT 2011
	 - labels for points and lines
	 - started documentation

0.003	 Tue Oct 11 15:14:33 NZDT 2011 (unpublished)
	 - increased robustness against non-existing intersections
           etc.
	 - changed intersection framework: it can now cater also for
	   other derived points than intersection points

0.002	 Wed Oct  5 19:52:38 NZDT 2011 (unpublished)
	 Intersection of lines with lines.

0.001    Sun Sep 25 19:25:49 NZDT 2011 (unpublished)
         Initial release, can draw points and lines.
