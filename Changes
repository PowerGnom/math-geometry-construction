Revision history for Math-Geometry-Construction

0.021	 Fri Mar 22 17:49:50 CET 2013 (unpublished)
	 - extreme_position selector accepts Line objects as
           direction
	 - support for setting dash patterns in a unified way for SVG
	   and TikZ output
	 - partial drawing of circles

	 - The extend attribute is turned into an array reference
	   with backward and forward extent. When setting the
	   attribute, this change is transparent since a value x is
	   coerced into [x, x]. However, when reading the value (not
	   a typical scenario), you get the array reference instead
	   of a single number.
	 - dabbling with operator overloading
	 - refactored and cleaned up test suite

0.019	 Sun Nov 20 12:19:09 NZDT 2011
	 - starting to use Moose types
	 - using coercion in order to accept Math::VectorReal
	   objects and array references as vectors; this means that
	   these types can now be used in mutators as well, not only
	   constructors

0.018	 Sat Nov 19 19:17:28 NZDT 2011
	 - bug fix: center and support of a Circle are made
	   readonly; of course, their positions can change, but the
	   point objects must stay the same, otherwise reuse of
	   circles will break
	 - result buffering to speed up large constructions

0.017	 Thu Nov 17 20:14:53 NZDT 2011
	 - find_or_add methods that allow the reuse of lines and
	   circles even if no reference or id has been kept

0.016	 Mon Nov 14 19:41:12 NZDT 2011
	 - fixed bug in SVG generation: if the transform attribute
	   was specified it leaked through to the SVG object and
	   made renderers choke
	 - the close_position and distant_position selectors now
	   allow to give Point object as reference instead of a
	   vector
	 - started example script on Malfatti's problem

0.015	 Sun Nov 13 15:23:37 NZDT 2011
	 - the view_box attribute for Math::Geometry::Construction
	   and its subclasses has gone; use the transform attribute
	   instead
	 - transform attribute allows simple coordinate
	   transformations, specifically a swap to a "normal"
	   mathematic right-handed system as opposed to SVG's
	   matrix-like system (positive y axis pointing down)

0.014	 Sat Nov 12 16:24:30 NZDT 2011
	 - switched the underlying vector class from
	   Math::VectorReal to Math::Vector::Real because the latter
	   supports 2D vectors natively
	 - expanded the test suite substantially

0.013	 unpublished
	 - Line offers a "normal" method now.
	 - Draw::SVG and Draw::TikZ can both process RGB arrays as
	   colors; this allows uniform color specification for both
	   output types

0.012	 Sat Nov  5 21:32:25 NZDT 2011
	 - a default point size can be set on construction level
	 - all roles have been moved into the
	   Math::Geometry::Construction::Role namespace; this should
	   have been done from the start
	 - new role DrawPoint to homogenize the treatment of Point
	   and DerivedPoint
	 - fixed filling and text color in TikZ output

0.011	 Thu Nov  3 19:35:09 NZDT 2011
	 - creation of multiple derived points in one go was
	   documented, but actually not implemented
	 - close_position and distant_position selectors
	 - docu corrections and extension
	 - test suite is still far from exhaustive, but at least
	   might deserve the title 'test suite' now

0.010	 Tue Nov  1 21:32:18 NZDT 2011
	 - Fixes two unprotected eval statements, please update.
	 - All constructors that expect a Math::VectorReal object
	   now also accept an ARRAY reference with [x, y] instead.
	 - To construct a circle, you can now give a radius instead
	   of a point on the periphery.
	 - some more tests

0.009	 Mon Oct 31 20:00:38 NZDT 2011
	 - 'radius' attribute of Math::Geometry::Construction::Point
	   is deprecated in favour of 'size'
	 - some convenience changes like default values and the
	   add_derived_point method
	 - expanded docu considerably

0.008	 Sun Oct 23 11:54:49 NZDT 2011
	 - initial support for TikZ output; this is highly
	   experimental and not documented, yet
	 - fixes bug in PointOnLine with quantile

0.007	 Wed Oct 19 20:44:11 NZDT 2011
	 - modified drawing framework in order to prepare it for
	   different output types than SVG; the method as_svg is now
	   only an alias for draw("SVG", ...)
	 - new derivates
	 - fixed "my $_" that had been introduced by find/replace
	   and blew smoke tests on Perl 5.8

0.006	 Sun Oct 16 18:38:08 NZDT 2011
	 - Changed point selection to position selection. This is
	   less future-safe, but more natural and avoids some
	   workarounds. The visible API change is that the point
	   selection methods are renamed to position selection
	   methods. They had not been documented, but showed up in
	   the SYNOPSIS.
	 - The width and height attributes have gone and should be
	   given directly to the output method. Background is now
	   transparent by default, but can be specified via the
	   background attribute.
	 - Lines now accept and expect the support points at
	   construction time.
	 - some more Derivative classes for user convenience

0.005	 Sat Oct 15 19:53:35 NZDT 2011
	 - circles and their intersections with lines and with each
           other
	 - some API simplifications for ease of use
	 - docu fixes and expansion; docu of the main module kind of
           complete

0.004	 Wed Oct 12 19:52:51 NZDT 2011
	 - labels for points and lines
	 - started documentation

0.003	 Tue Oct 11 15:14:33 NZDT 2011 (unpublished)
	 - increased robustness against non-existing intersections
           etc.
	 - changed intersection framework: it can now cater also for
	   other derived points than intersection points

0.002	 Wed Oct  5 19:52:38 NZDT 2011 (unpublished)
	 Intersection of lines with lines.

0.001    Sun Sep 25 19:25:49 NZDT 2011 (unpublished)
         Initial release, can draw points and lines.
