Revision history for Math-Geometry-Construction

	 - Changed point selection to position selection. This is
	   less future-safe, but more natural and avoids some
	   workarounds. The visible API change is that the point
	   selection methods are renamed to position selection
	   methods. They had not been documented, but showed up in
	   the SYNOPSIS.
	 - The width and height attributes have gone and should be
	   given directly to the output method. Background is now
	   transparent by default, but can be specified via the
	   background attribute.
	 - Lines now accept and expect the support points at
	   construction time.
	 - some more Derivative classes for user convenience

           other

           complete
