- intersections
  - concept:
    - Math::Geometry::Construction::Intersection has code to accept
      two (or more?) objects and dynamically applies the appropriate
      role, e.g.
      Math::Geometry::Construction::Intersection::CircleLine.
    - It also consumes PointSelection.
    - The roles provide the points method and possibly more point
      selection methods.
    - Math::Geometry::Construction::IntersectionPoint contains code
      to hold the Intersection object, the point selection method to
      call and its parameters. This is executed when the position
      method is called.
