- intersections
  - concept:
    - Math::Geometry::Construction::Intersection has code to accept
      two (or more?) objects and dynamically applies the appropriate
      role, e.g.
      Math::Geometry::Construction::Intersection::CircleLine.
    - It also consumes PointSelection.
    - The roles provide the points method and possibly more point
      selection methods.
    - Math::Geometry::Construction::IntersectionPoint contains code
      to hold the Intersection object, the point selection method to
      call and its parameters. This is executed when the position
      method is called.

- On creation of an intersection point, it should be added to the
  lists of POIs of the intersecting objects. The user should be able
  to inhibit this. I am unsure how he should be able to inihibit it
  specifically for some of the objects. Maybe I won't allow
  this. Anyway, it is planned to let objects ignore points. It can
  always be done very specifically this way.
